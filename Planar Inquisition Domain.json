With that came understanding of the flow of time and the matter of PlanarInquisiton space. Clerics of this domain the study of the rules of the cosmos, which by extension is the rule of the gods, as they created the cosmos we live in. This order of clerics attracts those drawn to knowledge and wonder, they may be the most travelled of the clerics, looking to document some of the worlds most weird and wonderful godly and arcane artefacts. The magic they have found with their deities is new, and some consider dangerous.",

As a result, they are sometimes met with suspicion or animosity by clerics of more ancient traditions. Where they are welcome, Time and Space cleric are often known as great educators or sometimes even detectives, as they are most often driven to find the facts that are sometimes not evident to the layman.",
