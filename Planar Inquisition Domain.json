				"Clerics of the Planar Inquisition Domain (sometimes called Clerics of Spacetime) are a new addition to the varied pantheon of clerics that came about with the discovery of Arcana thousands of years ago. With that came an understanding of the flow of time and the matter of Planar Inquisition space. Clerics of this domain study the rules of the cosmos, which by extension is the rule of the gods, as they created the cosmos we live in. This order of clerics attracts those drawn to knowledge and wonder. They may be the most traveled of the clerics, looking to document some of the world's most weird and wonderful godly and arcane artifacts. The magic they have found with their deities is new, and some consider it dangerous.",
				"Clerics of the Planar Inquisition Domain can be found side by side with wizards and sorcerers, understanding the way of the world and the magic that permeates through it. As a result, they are sometimes met with suspicion or animosity by clerics of more ancient traditions. Where they are welcome, Time and Space clerics are often known as great educators or sometimes even detectives, as they are most often driven to find the facts that are sometimes not evident to the layman.",
